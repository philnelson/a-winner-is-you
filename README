A Winner Is You is an achievements system for the web, similar to Xbox Live's Achievements, or Playstation 3's Trophies system.

== What's With The Name? ==

A Winner Is You's name is an homage to the NES game Pro Wrestling. Upon winning a match, the player is presented with a poorly-translated victory screen featuring their character, arms raised, and the text "A Winner Is You." It is a fairly famous example of early NES-era engrish.
